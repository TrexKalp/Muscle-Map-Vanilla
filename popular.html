                                      <li>Leaning too far forward or backward: Maintain a slight forward lean while performing the dips, but avoid leaning excessively forward or backward. This helps target the chest muscles effectively and maintains proper form.</li>

                                          <li>Lifting your hips off the seat: Keep your back firmly against the seat throughout the exercise. Lifting your hips off the seat can put undue stress on your lower back and decrease the effectiveness of the leg press.</li>
                                          <li>Locking your knees: While it's important to fully extend your legs during the leg press, avoid locking your knees at the top of the movement. Locking the knees can strain the joint and increase the risk of injury. Maintain a slight bend in your knees to keep tension on the muscles and protect your joints.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                          <li>Keeping your head up, chest lifted, and core engaged, initiate the movement by bending at the knees and hips simultaneously, as if sitting back into a chair. Ensure that your knees track in line with your toes.</li>

The primary movement should occur in the hips, with the knees serving as a hinge. Over-bending the knees can shift the emphasis away from the hamstrings and reduce the effectiveness of the exercise.</li>

Position your feet hip-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward. Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to grip the barbell with an overhand grip or a mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand).</li>
                                          <li>With your back straight, engage your core, and lift your chest. Keep your shoulders back and down. Your arms should be fully extended and hanging perpendicular to the ground. Ensure that your weight is balanced evenly over your feet.</li>
                                          <li>Initiate the movement by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the barbell off the ground. Keep your back straight and maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift. Stand tall with your shoulders back and squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement. Lower the barbell back to the ground by reversing the movement, hinging at the hips and bending your knees. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>

                                            <li>Place the balls of your feet on the foot platform, allowing your heels to hang off the edge. Ensure that your knees are slightly bent and your upper body is upright, with your hands holding the handles for support.</li>
                                            <li>Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels as high as possible, contracting your calf muscles. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly lower your heels back down until they are below the foot platform, feeling a stretch in your calf muscles.

                                              <li>Neglecting full range of motion: Ensure that you perform a full range of motion during seated calf raises. Lower your heels below the foot platform to fully stretch your calf muscles, and raise your heels as high as possible to fully contract them. Avoid shortening the movement or limiting your range of motion, as this can limit the benefits of the exercise.</li>

Bend your knees and hinge at the hips to grip the barbell with an overhand grip or a mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand).</li>

                                          <li>Initiate the movement by driving through your heels, extending your hips and knees simultaneously to lift the barbell off the ground. Keep your back straight and maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift. Stand tall with your shoulders back and squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.
